tagGIT
=======

Welcome to the tagGIT repository.

tagGIT lets you draw and export a Git repository to generate your desired Contribution Calendar.
There's a hosted version over at [http://taggit.ains.co](http://taggit.ains.co) if you want to have a play.

Getting Started
====
Getting started with hosting your own copy of tagGIT or developing on top of it couldn't be easier.

Flask is the only dependency of tagGIT, however if you don't have Flask already just run
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

Start the development server by running
"python app.py"
